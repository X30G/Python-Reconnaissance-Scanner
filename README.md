## üìå Purpose
This script automates the reconnaissance and scanning phase of a penetration test by combining **Nmap**, **socket-based banner grabbing**, and **web service analysis**. It intelligently parses scan results to focus on actual open services, making your recon more accurate and efficient.

---

## üìñ Description
The Smart Recon & Scanning Tool:
- Runs a **full-port Nmap scan** with service/version detection.
- Parses the Nmap **XML output** to find actual open services.
- Uses **socket** to grab banners from non-web services.
- Uses **Requests** + **BeautifulSoup** to analyze discovered web pages for titles and metadata.
- Supports **verbose mode** for detailed feedback or quiet mode for clean output.
- Saves results in both **TXT** and **XML** formats for later review or reporting.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Smart Targeting** ‚Äì Only analyzes services that Nmap finds open.
- **Web Recon** ‚Äì Automatically identifies and inspects HTTP/HTTPS services.
- **Banner Grabbing** ‚Äì Quickly identifies non-web services via `socket`.
- **Cross-Platform** ‚Äì Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with Python 3 + Nmap installed).
- **Output Files** ‚Äì Saves detailed scan results in `nmap_scan_<timestamp>.txt` and `.xml`.
- **Verbose/Quiet Modes** ‚Äì Toggle detailed output as needed.

---

## üõ† Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Nmap** installed and accessible in PATH
- Python modules:
```
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Run in quiet mode:
python3 python_recon.py <target> --quiet
```
